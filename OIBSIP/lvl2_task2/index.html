                When you feel sad, it's okay. It's not the end of the world. Everyone has those days when you doubt yourself, and when you 
                feel like everything you do sucks, but then there's those days when you feel like Superman. It's just the balance of the world. 
                I just write to feel better.

            Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 â€“ September 7, 2018), known professionally as Mac Miller, was an American rapper, 
            singer-songwriter, and record producer. Miller began his career in Pittsburgh's local hip hop scene in 2007, at the age of fifteen.
            In 2010, he signed a record deal with independent label Rostrum Records and released his breakthrough mixtapes K.I.D.S. (2010) 
            and Best Day Ever (2011). Miller's debut studio album, Blue Slide Park (2011), became the first independently distributed debut
